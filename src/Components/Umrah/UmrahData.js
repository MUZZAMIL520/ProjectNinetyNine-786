      "Umrah consists of four essential practices. Firstly, you get changed into the Ihram garments before the Miqat, perform two Rakahs of Salah and make your Niyyah as the Miqat approaches, thereafter reciting the Talbiyah frequently. Secondly, you perform Tawaf al-Umrah of the Kaaba followed by two Rakahs of Salah, preferably near Maqam Ibrahim. Thirdly, you do Sa’i of Safa and Marwah. Lastly, you shave (Halq) or shorten (Taqsir) your hair allowing you to leave the state of Ihram and complete your Umrah Physical Purity"

      "Before getting into changed into the Ihram garments, "+
      "take care of your personal hygiene by clipping your nails and removing the hair under your armpits and beneath the navel. You should then do Ghusl, a highly emphasised Sunnah for those intending to enter into a state of Ihram. If you can’t perform Ghusl, doing Wudhu will suffice. Men may apply Attar / perfume to their heads / beards, ensuring not to get any on the Ihram garments. This should all be carried out at your place of residence before your flight (assuming you’re flying)"

      "You will then get changed into your Ihram garments which for men consists of two, normally white, clean seamless pieces of cloth. The sheet which wraps around the waist covering the lower body is known as the Izar and the sheet that is draped over the upper body like a shawl is known as the Rida. Sandals shouldn’t cover the heel and ankle. The Hanafi school of thought also stipulates that the top part of the foot should also remain exposed.Ensure you put on your Ihram attire before crossing the designated Miqat. You will likely be travelling to Saudi Arabia via plane, so is advisable to get changed into your Ihram at the airport prior to departure or during a stopover if you have one. Check-in first and get changed in the prayer room or bathroom. Alternatively, you can put on your Ihram in-flight although bear in mind that airplane bathrooms are usually very limited in space and there may well be a rush of people intending to do the same thing as the Miqat approaches. If you decide to slip into your Ihram attire on the plane, do so at least an hour before the Miqat is crossed."

      "It’s Sunnah to perform two Rakahs of Salah before entering into the state of Ihram. This can be performed after getting changed at the airport or in-flight before crossing the Miqat providing there are prayer facilities on-board.  Observe the prayer with the intention of performing two Rakahs Nafl for Ihram Since you’re not yet in the spiritual state of Ihram, the prayer may be observed with the head covered. It is recommended to recite Surah al-Kafirun (Surah 109) in the first Rakah and Surah al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) in the second, although other Surahs may be read. Don’t forget to make Dua after this Salah."

    name: "Niyyah:",
    detail:
      "The Niyyah for Umrah should be made at the Miqat or close to it as you move in its direction. Ideally, you should delay making the intention until the last moment so you aren’t restricted by its prohibitions for longer than need be. It is recommended (Mustahabb) that you make the intention verbally, as well as reiterating it internally.Following are three examples of intentions that may be uttered in Arabic:لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ عُمْرَةًLabbayka llāhumma ‘umratan.O Allah, here I am to perform Umrah.اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّيْ أُرِيْدُ الْعُمْرَةَAllāhumma innī urīdu l-‘umrata.O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah.اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّيْ أُرِيْدُ الْعُمْرَةَ فَيَسِّرْهَا لِيْ وَتَقَبَّلْهَا مِنِّيْAllāhumma innī urīdu l-‘umrata fa yassirhā lī wa taqabbalhā minnī.O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah, so accept it from me and make it easy for me."

    name: "Talbiyah:",
    detail:
      "After making your Niyyah, you must recite the Talbiyah to validate your intention and enter into the state of Ihram. The utterance of the Talbiyah is Wajib according to the Hanafi and Maliki schools of thought. The Shafi’i and Hanbali schools consider it a Sunnah.لَبَّيْكَ اللهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ – لَبَّيْكَ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ – إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ – لَا شَرِيْكَ لَكَ –Labbayka llāhumma labbayk(a), labbayka lā sharīka laka labbayk(a), inna l-ḥamda wa n-ni’mata, laka wa l-mulk(a), lā sharīka lak.At Your service, Allah, at Your service.
